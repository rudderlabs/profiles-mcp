    Prerequisites:
    - Get all the necessary information about profiles project from the following tools:
        - about_profiles() or about_profiles(topic="profiles")
        - about_profiles(topic="cli")

    This tool helps you:
    - View all existing warehouse connections configured for profiles
    - Select an appropriate connection for your pb_project.yaml configuration
    - Verify connection availability before project setup

    Usage workflow:
    1. Run this tool to get a list of available connections
    2. Choose a connection from the returned list
    3. Use the chosen connection name in your pb_project.yaml file under the 'connection' field
    If no connections are available, you can create a new one using the pb-cli:
    ```
    pb init connection
    ```

    - Selecting a warehouse type (Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.)
    - Providing connection credentials
    - Testing the connection
    - Saving the connection for future use

    **AI Agent Workflow Instructions:**

    **STEP 1: Always call `get_existing_connections()` first to check available connections.**

    **STEP 2: Based on the results, follow this decision tree:**

    **Scenario A - Multiple connections found:**
    - DO NOT choose a connection arbitrarily
    - MUST ask the user: "I found multiple connections: [list connection names]. Which connection would you like to use?"
    - WAIT for user response before proceeding
    - Use the user-selected connection_name with this tool

    **Scenario B - Single connection found:**
    - Use that connection directly without asking the user
    - Call this tool with just the connection_name parameter

    **Scenario C - No connections found or empty list:**
    - Inform the user: "No existing connections found. I'll help you create a new connection."
    - Run the command: `pb init connection` using run_terminal_cmd
    - This opens an interactive terminal where the user will enter connection details
    - After the user completes the interactive setup, call `get_existing_connections()` again
    - Use the newly created connection with this tool

    # Scenario B: Single connection auto-selected
    result = initialize_warehouse_connection(connection_name="only_connection")

    # Scenario C: After pb init connection completed
    result = initialize_warehouse_connection(connection_name="newly_created_conn")

    IMPORTANT: The schema in the active ctx warehouse session is not where the output tables are created. So this tool MUST be used to know where the output tables are.
    It also gives the exact table names of the feature views and id stitcher tables.

    Sets up the Python environment and dependencies for a RudderStack Profiles project.

    **WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL:**
    - **New Projects**: Initial setup of a brand new profiles project
    - **Environment Issues**: When encountering Python or dependency problems at ANY stage
    - **Missing Dependencies**: When `pb` commands fail due to missing packages
    - **Virtual Environment Problems**: When existing venv is broken or corrupted
    - **Python Version Issues**: When Python 3.10+ is not available in current environment

    **PREFERRED OVER**: Manual conda environments, pip installs, or other package management approaches

    ⚠️ **WORKFLOW TIP**: Consider calling `profiles_workflow_guide()` first for guided setup sequence.

    Before calling this tool, you should get the current working directory using the 'pwd' tool.

    **Environment Setup Steps:**
    1. Creates the project directory if it doesn't exist.
    2. Checks if Python 3.10 is installed.
    3. Creates a Python virtual environment (.venv) in the project directory.
    4. Installs the profiles-rudderstack package in the virtual environment.
    5. Installs the profiles-mlcorelib package in the virtual environment.

    **Smart Skipping**: The tool intelligently skips steps that have already been completed, such as:
    - Existing virtual environment that's working
    - Already installed profiles-rudderstack package
    - Already installed profiles-mlcorelib package

    **Use Cases:**
    - Setting up a new profiles project from scratch
    - Fixing broken Python environments in existing projects
    - Resolving "command not found" errors for `pb` CLI
    - Upgrading or reinstalling profiles dependencies
    - Switching between different Python versions

    This tool focuses on creating the basic project structure and installing necessary Python dependencies.
    For configuring your `pb_project.yaml`, `inputs.yaml`, `profiles.yaml`, and other aspects of your RudderStack Profiles project,
    please use other available MCP tools such as `about_profiles(topic="project")`, `about_profiles(topic="inputs")`, `about_profiles(topic="models")`, etc.

    Evaluates a list of SQL filters to find the best one for defining an eligible user segment.

    This tool analyzes different SQL conditions to identify an optimal filter for segmenting users.
    It calculates metrics like segment size, positive/negative label counts, positive rate, and recall
    against an overall positive population. The best filter is chosen based on maximizing recall,
    with segment size as a tie-breaker, while adhering to specified positive rate and minimum segment size constraints.

    This is useful for data-driven decision-making in campaign targeting, feature engineering, or model training,
    where identifying a well-balanced and sufficiently large group of "eligible" users is crucial.

    Args:
        ctx: The MCP context.
        filter_sqls: A list of SQL WHERE clause conditions (strings) to evaluate.
                     Example: ["country = 'US' AND age > 30", "last_seen_days < 90"]
        label_table: The fully qualified name of the table containing the label and entity information.
                     Example: "my_database.my_schema.user_labels"
        label_column: The column in 'label_table' that indicates the positive label.
                      It's assumed that a value of 1 signifies a positive label. Example: "is_converted"
        entity_column: The column in 'label_table' that serves as the unique identifier for entities.
                       Example: "user_id"
        min_pos_rate: The minimum acceptable positive rate (positive labels / total in segment) for a filter.
                      Defaults to 0.10 (10%).
        max_pos_rate: The maximum acceptable positive rate (positive labels / total in segment) for a filter.
                      Defaults to 0.90 (90%).
        min_total_rows: The minimum number of total eligible entities (rows) for a filter to be considered valid.
                        Defaults to 5000.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with two keys:
              'best_filter': The SQL string of the filter identified as optimal. None if no filter meets the criteria.
              'metrics': A dictionary of metrics for the 'best_filter'. Includes 'filter_sql',
                         'eligible_rows', 'positive_label_rows', 'negative_label_rows',

#     Analyzes the structure of an existing profiles project offline.

#     This tool is designed for CSMs and users who need to understand existing projects
#     without warehouse access. It performs efficient project structure analysis including:

#     **Project Structure Analysis:**
#     - Reads pb_project.yaml and extracts model_folders configuration
#     - Scans YAML files within the specified model_folders only
#     - Provides project config metadata and file inventory
#     - Returns comprehensive project summary and statistics


#     **Use Cases:**
#     - Understanding existing customer projects during support
#     - Debugging project configuration issues offline
#     - Getting project overview without running pb commands
#     - Validating project structure before warehouse setup

#     **Requirements:**
#     - Project path must contain pb_project.yaml in the root
#     - Files are read-only (no warehouse access needed)
#     - Supports projects with any YAML filename variations
#     - Requires basic profiles knowledge to interpret results properly
#       (call about_profiles() first if using via workflow_guide)
      
#     **Before Calling:**
#     - This should never be the first tool call in a session. ENSURE YOU HAVE CALLED about_profiles(topic="profiles") before you call this tool.

    Validates propensity model configuration for common pitfalls before running the model.

    It is highly recommended to run this tool AFTER a propensity model is configured and BEFORE

    The validator checks for common pitfalls while defining the propensity model config, such as features coming from static tables with no historic data, configuration checks etc
    This helps prevent common mistakes and improves the reliability of propensity model runs.

    IMPORTANT: A profiles project can occasionally contain multiple propensity models. This tool should be called once per propensity model.
